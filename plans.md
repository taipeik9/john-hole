# Overall Goals with this Repo

TODO: Spellcheck "received"

Things I want users to be able to do on the application:
- [ ] Search name and see individual stats
	- [ ] messages sent
	- [ ] reactions received
	- [ ] message to image ratio
	- [ ] sent message search?
	- [ ] reacted messages search?
- [ ] See entire stats of the hole / rank people (maybe only top 10 will be visible)
	- [ ] Readily available homepage with everyone's stats for the month
	- [ ] Messages sent bar graph
	- [ ] Reactions received ratio
	- [ ] total stats, total messages sent in the month, total reactions sent in a month
- [ ] Awards page for users with outstanding scores: "the giggler", "the essayist", "the star", "the holer", "the photographer", "the farmer"
